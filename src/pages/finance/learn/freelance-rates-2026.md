Being a freelancer in 2026 is harder than it looks on social media. If you're still just charging "what the other guy charges," you're likely losing money every month.

## The Hidden Drain
Self-employment taxes and the rising cost of private health insurance in 2026 are eating margins. In the UK, the IR35 rules have "softened," but the compliance burden is still on you. If you're a London contractor, the shift toward milestone-based payments is the only way to protect your income.

## The AI Effect
AI hasn't replaced freelancers, but it has commoditized basic work. To maintain your rates in 2026, you have to provide the strategy that the AI can't. If you're just "doing the task," your rate will inevitably fall.
