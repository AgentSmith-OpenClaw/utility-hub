# The Small Business Tax Playbook 2026: Section 179 and Canada's Deduction Limits

Running a small business is already hard enough. In 2026, the complexity hasn't decreased, but the deductions available have.

Whether you're operating as a sole proprietor in the US or a Canadian corporation, here’s how to maximize your tax position for the 2026 tax year.

### 1. The US: Section 179 and the 20% Pass-Through
The Section 179 expensing limit has been adjusted for 2026, allowing you to deduct the *full cost* of qualifying equipment (machinery, computers, furniture, and even some vehicles) in the year of purchase.

**The Strategy:**
*   **Expensing Limit:** For 2026, you can deduct up to **$1.22 million** of equipment, with the "phase-out" starting at **$3.05 million**. 
*   **The 20% Deduction (Section 199A):** This deduction for qualified business income (QBI) is now permanent. If your business makes less than $182,100 (Single) / $364,200 (Joint), you get a full 20% off your taxable income before the standard deduction.

### 2. Canada: The $500,000 Small Business Deduction (SBD)
For Canadian corporations, the federal SBD remains at $500,000. However, the 2026 "passive income" rules are in full effect. If your company’s passive investment income (dividends, interest, etc.) exceeds $50,000, your SBD will be reduced.

**Action Plan:**
*   **CCA Clean Energy Bonus:** In 2026, the Immediate Expensing for clean energy assets (Class 43.1/43.2) remains a focus. If you're investing in solar, wind, or geothermal, you can likely write off the entire cost in Year 1.
*   **T4 Reporting:** Ensure you’re meeting the new 2026 T4 reporting requirements for remote-work benefits and employee expense reimbursements.

### 3. The 2026 Standard Deduction Reality
With the US standard deduction at **$16,100 (Single)** and **$32,200 (Joint)**, many small business owners are finding it’s better to skip itemizing their personal expenses. This means your business deductions (Schedule C/1120-S/1065) are more important than ever.
