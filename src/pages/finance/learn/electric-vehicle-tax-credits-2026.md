# The Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Update: US and EU 2026 Guide

If you're in the market for an EV in 2026, the tax incentive landscape has shifted. For both the US and the EU, the focus is now on local production and battery sourcing.

Here’s the breakdown of what's available for your next electric car, and how to make sure you get the maximum benefit.

### 1. The US: The $7,500 Tax Credit (Section 30D)
The $7,500 Clean Vehicle Credit is still the main event in the US. However, in 2026, the "Foreign Entity of Concern" (FEOC) rules are at their strictest level yet. This means if any part of your car’s battery was sourced from a restricted country (China, Russia, etc.), the credit is gone.

**The Strategy:** Check the VIN of your car. Even the same model could have a different credit value depending on where its battery was made.
*   **Point-of-Sale Transfer:** In 2026, you can still "transfer" the credit to your dealer at the time of purchase, effectively turning it into an instant $7,500 rebate.
*   **Income Caps:** Remember, the $150,000 (Single) / $300,000 (Joint) income caps are still in place. If you're over the limit, the credit is $0.

### 2. The EU: The "Bonus Malus" Era
Across the EU, the focus is moving away from direct cash subsidies and toward tax-based incentives.
*   **Germany's Umweltbonus:** If you missed the direct cash subsidies, look into the company car tax breaks. EVs in 2026 still enjoy a significantly lower tax rate (usually 0.25% or 0.5% of the list price) for benefit-in-kind taxation.
*   **The Netherlands & Norway:** The phase-out of registration tax exemptions is nearly complete, but the annual road tax benefits remain significant for zero-emission vehicles.

### 3. Home Charging Credits
Don't forget the charging station. In the US, the 30C credit (up to $1,000) for home charging equipment is still available for those in designated census tracts (non-urban and low-income areas).

**Action Plan:** Check if your zip code qualifies before you install your charger. Our [EV Savings Calculator](/tools/ev-incentive-lookup) has been updated with the 2026 census data.
