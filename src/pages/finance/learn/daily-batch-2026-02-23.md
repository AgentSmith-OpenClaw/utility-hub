# Understanding the 2026 US Tax Season: Why Refunds are Up

The 2026 tax season is here, and it’s bringing some good news for American households. Early IRS data shows that even though they've processed fewer returns so far, the average check is about 11% higher than last year.

## Why are checks bigger?
As of mid-February, the average refund is roughly $2,290. This jump isn't random; it's mostly due to a few practical changes:
- **Inflation adjustments:** The IRS moved tax brackets and the standard deduction up to keep pace with the cost of living.
- **New rules:** New provisions from recent tax bills are finally showing up in people's filings.
- **Standard deduction:** For a lot of people, the higher deduction simply lowered their taxable income more than usual.

## Important dates
The IRS is moving a bit slower this year—processing about 20.6 million returns by early February—so don't wait until the last minute.
- **April 15, 2026:** This is the big one. Most people need to file by today.
- **Extensions:** You can push the filing date to October 15, but you still have to pay what you owe by April.

## Where is your money?
The "Where's My Refund?" tool is still the best way to track your status. Most people get their money within three weeks if they file online. Direct deposit is the fastest route, with those refunds averaging $2,388.

If you’re planning to use that money to pay off debt, you can use our [Amortization Calculator](/finance/amortization-calculator) to see how much interest you'll save by making a big one-time payment.

# Bank of England Interest Rates: Will They Finally Cut in March?

For everyone in the UK with a mortgage or a savings account, the big question is when the Bank of England will finally move. After a very close 5-4 vote to keep rates at 3.75% in February, all the attention is now on the March meeting.

## The case for a lower rate
Inflation dropped to 3% in January, mostly because petrol and food got a bit cheaper. Combined with unemployment rising to 5.2%, there's a lot of pressure on the Bank to act.
- **Market bets:** Most traders in the City expect a cut in March.
- **Slow growth:** The economy isn't exactly booming, which usually means it's time to lower rates to get things moving.

## What it means for you
A cut would be great news if you're on a variable-rate mortgage or need to remortgage soon. But if you have money in savings, expect your interest rate to drop. In fact, most UK banks have already started cutting their rates in anticipation.

If you’re thinking about remortgaging, use our [Mortgage Repayment Calculator](/finance/mortgage-calculator) to see how the new rates compare to what you’re paying now.

# Canada’s Cold Housing Market: More Houses, Fewer Buyers

Canada’s housing market is in a weird spot as we start 2026. There are more houses for sale, but fewer people are actually buying them, especially in central Canada.

## Sales are down, inventory is up
Home sales fell nearly 6% in January. At the same time, new listings jumped by over 7%, especially in Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary.
- **Wait and see:** Buyers are waiting to see if the Bank of Canada is really done with high interest rates.
- **Building slowdown:** Construction starts dropped 15% in January. While there's plenty for sale now, we might see another shortage in a year or two.

## Regional differences
While Montreal and Calgary have plenty of new listings, nothing is moving very fast. This gives buyers a rare chance to negotiate on price.

# The ECB’s Next Move: New Leadership and Mixed Signals

The European Central Bank is going through a lot of changes right now. Between rumors that Christine Lagarde might leave early and the very different economic situations in each country, it’s a complicated time for European money.

## A split continent
France has very low inflation right now, which makes their 2% interest rate feel much higher than it is. Other countries are still seeing prices go up faster than they'd like.
- **The leadership race:** Rumors that Lagarde might quit to help out in the French elections have added a lot of political drama to the bank's decisions.
- **Staying cautious:** Despite the drama, the ECB will probably wait until inflation is steady at 2% across the whole Eurozone before they make any big cuts.

## What should investors do?
All this uncertainty means the Euro might be a bit jumpy for a while. If you're managing investments or crypto, you can track your gains and taxes with our [Crypto Tax Calculator](/finance/crypto-tax-calculator).

# Portfolio Strategy in 2026: Life After the AI Boom

After a massive run in AI stocks, 2026 is the year many investors are starting to spread their money around. Tech is still important, but putting all your eggs in one basket is looking riskier.

## Why diversify now?
The tech slump that started late last year is hitting other industries too. It’s a good reminder that balance matters.
- **Bonds are back:** With interest rates still decent, bonds and high-yield savings are actually worth having again.
- **Emerging markets:** Some people are looking at markets outside the US for growth, as long as trade wars don't get in the way.

## Three tips for 2026
1. **Check your tech:** Make sure you aren't too dependent on just a few big AI companies.
2. **Look for dividends:** Stocks that pay you regularly can help when the market is shaky.
3. **Keep cash handy:** High-yield savings accounts are still a great place for your emergency fund while rates stay up.

# Student Loan Tips for 2026: How to Pay Less

Paying back student loans is still a massive headache in the US, UK, and Canada. But the rules have changed for 2026, and your strategy should too.

## US: New plans, same debt
In the US, most people are moving to income-driven plans. After all the court battles in 2025, understanding Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is still tricky but worth the effort.

## UK: The Plan 2 vs Plan 5 trap
UK graduates are still dealing with high interest on Plan 2 loans. If you're on the newer Plan 5, you'll be paying for longer. You have to think of it like an extra tax on your paycheck.

## Canada: Still interest-free
The best news is in Canada, where federal loans are still interest-free. This means you can focus on paying off higher-interest debt (like credit cards or car loans) first.

Before you decide to make an extra payment, use our [Loan Repayment Calculator](/finance/amortization-calculator) to see if that money would be better off in a savings account instead.
