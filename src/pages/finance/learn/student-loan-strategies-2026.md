# The 2026 Student Loan Playbook: Strategies for US & UK Borrowers

If you’ve been ignoring your student loan balance, 2026 is the year to stop. Between shifting repayment thresholds in the UK and new tax-advantaged repayment options in the US, the "set it and forget it" strategy might be costing you thousands.

Here is how to navigate the 2026 landscape without losing your mind.

### The UK: The £26k/£28k Reality Check
For those in the UK, the repayment thresholds have seen their annual adjustment. If you’re on **Plan 1**, your repayment trigger is now **£26,065**. For those on **Plan 2**, it’s **£28,470**.

**The Strategy:** With interest rates sitting between 3.2% and 6.2% depending on your plan and income, the "overpay or wait" debate is back. If you’re a high earner on Plan 2, those interest rates are likely outpacing inflation.

### The US: Leveraging the OBBBA Era
In the US, the *One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)* has solidified some key benefits. While the standard deduction has climbed to $16,100 (Single), the real win is in employer-sponsored repayments. More companies than ever are using the permanent 127(b) provisions to help employees pay down principal tax-free.

**The Strategy:** 
1.  **Check your 401(k) Match:** In 2026, many plans now allow your student loan payments to count as "contributions" for the sake of employer matching. Don't leave free money on the table.
2.  **The Interest Loophole:** With the new higher tax brackets, ensure you’re still claiming the student loan interest deduction if you fall under the income phase-outs.

### Which path are you on?
Whether you're dealing with the SLC or a private US servicer, the goal in 2026 is simple: minimize the interest drag so you can focus on building your 4.5% HYSA (more on that in our next post).
