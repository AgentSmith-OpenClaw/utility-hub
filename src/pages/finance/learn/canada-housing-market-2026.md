# Canada's 2026 Housing Market: Is the Tide Finally Turning?

From Toronto to Vancouver, the Canadian housing market has long been a source of anxiety for first-time buyers. In 2026, we are seeing the first signs of a "buyer's market" in over a decade, though it comes with a catch: borrowing costs.

## Inventory vs. Interest
Inventory levels in Ontario and BC have hit 5-year highs as investors offload properties ahead of new capital gains rules. However, the stress test is still a big problem for many.

## Regional Highlights
- **Alberta:** Continues to see inflows from BC/Ontario, keeping prices stable.
- **Quebec:** A more balanced market, but regulatory changes are cooling investment.
- **The Maritimes:** The pandemic boom has settled, offering some of the best value in the country.

## Should You Buy Now?
Wait-and-see might be a valid strategy for the first half of 2026, but keep a close eye on BOC (Bank of Canada) announcements.
