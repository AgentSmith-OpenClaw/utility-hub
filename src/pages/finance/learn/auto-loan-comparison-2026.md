# Auto Loans in 2026: Lease vs. Buy in a High-Rate Environment

Buying a car in 2026 feels very different than it did five years ago. With EV incentives shifting and interest rates remaining stubbornly high, the math of "lease vs. buy" has changed significantly.

## Buying with a Loan
Expect to see APRs between 6% and 9% for good credit scores. While you build equity, the depreciation of traditional ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles is accelerating as the market moves toward hybrid and electric.

## The Case for Leasing
Leasing offers lower monthly payments and protects you from the long-term depreciation risks of new battery technology. However, you're essentially renting the car and have nothing to show for it at the end.

## Key Considerations
- **Total Cost of Ownership:** Don't just look at the monthly payment. Factor in insurance (higher for EVs) and maintenance.
- **GAP Insurance:** Essential if you're putting less than 20% down.
