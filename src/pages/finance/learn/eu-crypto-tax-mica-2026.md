# EU Crypto Tax Guide 2026: Understanding MiCA and Regional Rules

With the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation fully in force across the European Union, crypto investing has moved from the "Wild West" to a strictly regulated financial activity.

## MiCA's Impact on You
MiCA doesn't directly set tax rates—that's still up to individual member states—but it does require exchanges to report data to tax authorities. If you're trading in Germany, France, or Italy, your local tax office likely already knows about your gains.

## Regional Breakdown
- **Germany:** Holdings over one year remain tax-free for individuals, making it a "HODLer's paradise."
- **France:** The 30% flat tax (flat tax PFU) remains the standard for most retail investors.
- **Italy:** New thresholds for capital gains mean more casual traders are being pulled into the tax net.

## Why Compliance is Non-Negotiable
The cost of an audit far outweighs the cost of proper tracking. Ensure you are using FIFO or average cost basis as required by your jurisdiction.
