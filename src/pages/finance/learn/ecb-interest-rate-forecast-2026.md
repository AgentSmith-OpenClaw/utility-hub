The European Central Bank has hit the brakes and kept them there. The deposit rate is stuck at 2.00%, and from where we stand in February 2026, it's not moving anytime soon.

## What This Means
For most Europeans, this is actually good news. Predictability has returned to the mortgage market. Savings rates have also peaked, making it a good time to lock in a fixed-rate savings account before the eventual (but slow) decline begins.

## The Risk Factor
The Euro is still vulnerable to global energy prices. While the ECB can control internal rates, it can't control the cost of imported gas or global trade tensions. If you're in the Eurozone, your mortgage might be stable, but your utility bills are still at the mercy of geopolitics.
