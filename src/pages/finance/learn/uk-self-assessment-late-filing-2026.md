# So You Missed the Jan 31 Deadline. Now What?

It happens. Maybe life got in the way, maybe you were waiting on a P60 that never arrived, or maybe the date just slipped your mind. But here we are in February 2026, and your Self-Assessment tax return for the 2024/2025 tax year is officially late.

First, take a breath. Panic won't solve anything, but action will. HMRC penalties are strict, but they aren't instant doom if you handle the situation correctly.

This guide walks you through exactly what happens next, how much it’s going to cost, and—crucially—how to stop the bleeding.

## The Immediate Cost: The £100 Fixed Penalty

The moment the clock struck midnight on February 1st, 2026, a **£100 fixed penalty** was applied to your account.

Here is the kicker: **You have to pay this even if you have no tax to pay.** Even if you owe £0, or are due a refund, the failure to file on time triggers this automatic fine.

### Does it get worse?
Yes. The £100 is just the "welcome" fee. If you continue to delay, the penalties escalate rapidly:

*   **3 Months Late (April 30, 2026):** Daily penalties of £10 per day kick in, up to a maximum of £900 (for 90 days).
*   **6 Months Late (July 31, 2026):** An additional penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater.
*   **12 Months Late (Jan 31, 2027):** Another 5% or £300 charge. In serious cases (where HMRC suspects you are withholding information deliberately), this can jump to 100% of the tax due.

## Step 1: File the Return Immediately

Don't wait to pay the fine before filing. The clock on the *daily* penalties starts ticking in three months. Your priority is to get the return submitted so you stop accruing potential future fines.

Use the **[Toolisk Income Tax Calculator](/finance/calculators/income-tax)** to get a quick estimate of what your liability might look like before you log into the HMRC portal. It helps to be mentally prepared for the number.

## Step 2: Calculate Interest on Late Payments

The £100 fine is for *filing* late. There is separate interest for *paying* late.

As of February 2026, HMRC's late payment interest rate is hovering around **7.75%** (tracking the Bank of England base rate plus 2.5%). This interest is charged daily from the due date (Jan 31) until the payment is made.

If you owe £5,000 in tax, every month you delay adds roughly £32 in interest. It's not catastrophic immediately, but it compounds.

## Can You Appeal the Penalty?

HMRC isn't heartless, but they are strict. You can appeal the £100 penalty if you have a **"reasonable excuse."**

### What counts as a reasonable excuse?
*   A partner or close relative died shortly before the deadline.
*   You had an unexpected stay in the hospital.
*   You had a serious or life-threatening illness.
*   Your computer or software failed just before or while you were preparing your return.
*   Service issues with HMRC online services.
*   A fire, flood, or theft prevented you from completing the return.

### What DOESN'T count?
*   "I forgot."
*   "My accountant was slow." (HMRC views your accountant as your agent; their failure is your failure).
*   "I didn't know the deadline."
*   "I didn't have the money to pay." (You must still file on time, even if you can't pay).

If you believe you have a genuine case, you must file your return first, wait for the penalty notice, and then appeal using **Form SA370** or via the online portal.

## Cannot Pay? Set Up a "Time to Pay" Arrangement

This is the most underutilized tool in the taxpayer's arsenal. If you've filed your return but simply don't have the cash to clear the bill, **do not ignore it.**

You can set up a **Time to Pay** arrangement online if:
*   You owe less than £30,000.
*   You are within 60 days of the payment deadline.
*   You plan to pay off the debt within the next 12 months.

This stops the late payment penalties (though interest still accrues). It converts your tax bill into manageable monthly direct debits.

**Strategy:** File the return today. Then, immediately call the Business Payment Support Service (BPSS) or set up the plan online.

## Preventing This in 2027

The 2025/2026 tax year ends on April 5, 2026. You have until January 31, 2027, to file that return.

Why wait until January? The most organized taxpayers file in **May or June**.
1.  **Certainty:** You know exactly what you owe 7 months in advance.
2.  **Cashflow:** You can keep the tax money in a high-yield savings account (earning ~4-5%) until January, effectively getting a discount on your tax bill.
3.  **No Stress:** You avoid the "January Scramble."

Use our **[Toolisk Tax Planner](/finance/calculators/tax-planner)** to track your income monthly so the final number is never a surprise.

## Summary Checklist

1.  **File NOW.** Stop the filing delay clock.
2.  **Pay what you can.** Even a partial payment reduces interest.
3.  **Set up a Time to Pay plan** if you can't clear the balance.
4.  **Check for reasonable excuses** and appeal if valid.
5.  **Start your 2027 return early.**

Don't let one missed deadline spiral into a year of debt. Tackle it head-on today.
