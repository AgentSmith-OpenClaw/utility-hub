Canada's housing market has spent the last two years in a state of shock. In 2026, we're finally seeing a "new normal." The chaos of 2025 is over, but don't expect a return to the 2% rates of the past.

## The Benchmark
Most experts have settled on 6.18% as the predicted average for the year. It's high enough to hurt, but steady enough to plan around. Fixed rates are becoming more competitive as bond markets calm down, while variable rates remain a gamble on the Bank of Canada's next move.

## Supply is the Problem
Housing starts dropped in January. This means that even if rates fall slightly, prices aren't going to crash. There simply isn't enough inventory in cities like Toronto or Vancouver to meet demand. If you're waiting for a "market collapse" to buy, you might be waiting a long time.

## Crypto Taxes
The CRA is matching the IRS's energy. If you traded crypto in 2025, you need to report it in your 2026 filing. They are looking at crypto-to-crypto trades specifically—those are taxable events, even if you never touched "real" money.
