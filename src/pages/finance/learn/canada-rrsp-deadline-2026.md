# RRSP Deadline Alert: March 2, 2026

For Canadians, February isn't just about surviving winter—it's "RRSP Season." The deadline to make a contribution that counts against your **2025 tax year** is fast approaching: **Monday, March 2, 2026.**

Why March 2? Because March 1st falls on a Sunday. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) extends the deadline to the next business day.

This guide covers everything you need to know about optimizing your contribution, avoiding over-contribution penalties, and making the smart choice between RRSP and TFSA.

## The Basics: Contribution Room & Limits

Your RRSP deduction limit for 2025 is **18% of your earned income** from the previous year (2024), up to a maximum of **$32,490**, plus any unused contribution room carried forward from previous years.

### How to Find Your Exact Room
Don't guess. Over-contributing by more than $2,000 triggers a nasty **1% per month penalty** on the excess amount.
1.  **Check your Notice of Assessment (NOA):** The paper or digital notice you received after filing your 2024 taxes lists your "2025 RRSP Deduction Limit."
2.  **Log into CRA My Account:** The "RRSP and TFSA" section shows your real-time available room.
3.  **Use the MyCRA App:** Quick access on your phone.

## Strategy: RRSP vs. TFSA in 2026

The eternal question: "Should I put $5,000 into my RRSP or my TFSA?"

The answer depends entirely on your current tax bracket vs. your expected retirement tax bracket.

### Scenario A: High Income Earner ($100k+)
**Verdict: RRSP First.**
*   **Why:** You are likely in a high marginal tax bracket (43% in Ontario, 41% in BC). A $10,000 contribution generates a **$4,100 - $4,300 tax refund.**
*   **The Play:** Reinvest that refund. Don't spend it on a vacation. Putting the refund into your TFSA supercharges your savings rate. This is the "Refund Maximizer" strategy.
*   **Tool:** Use the **[Toolisk RRSP Savings Calculator](/finance/calculators/rrsp-savings)** to see exactly how much refund you'll generate.

### Scenario B: Moderate Income ($50k - $90k)
**Verdict: It Depends.**
*   If you expect your income to rise significantly in the future, save the RRSP room for those high-earning years. Max out your TFSA first.
*   The **2026 TFSA contribution limit** is likely **$7,000** (indexed to inflation). Prioritize filling this tax-free bucket if you think your tax rate will be *higher* in retirement (e.g., due to OAS/GIS clawbacks).

### Scenario C: Low Income (<$50k)
**Verdict: TFSA All Day.**
*   RRSP deductions offer little value at the lowest tax brackets (20%).
*   Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed and could reduce government benefits like GIS.
*   TFSAs are completely tax-free on withdrawal and don't affect benefits.

## The "Gross-Up" Strategy (Advanced)

If you have $10,000 cash to contribute but want the tax benefits of a larger contribution, use a short-term "RRSP Loan" to gross up your contribution.

**Example:**
*   You have $10,000.
*   Your marginal tax rate is 40%.
*   You borrow $6,666 and contribute a total of **$16,666.**
*   This generates a refund of roughly **$6,666** (40% of $16,666).
*   You use the refund to pay off the loan immediately in April/May.
*   **Result:** You have $16,666 working for you instead of $10,000, at no extra cost (minus a month of interest).

**Warning:** Only do this if you file early and file electronically to get your refund quickly!

## 2026 First Home Savings Account (FHSA) Factor

Don't forget the **FHSA**. If you are a first-time home buyer, this account combines the best of both worlds:
1.  **Tax Deduction:** Contributions reduce your taxable income (like an RRSP).
2.  **Tax-Free Withdrawal:** Qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase are tax-free (like a TFSA).

**Priority Ranking for 2026:**
1.  **Employer Match:** Always take the free money in a Group RRSP/DPSP.
2.  **FHSA:** Max out the $8,000 annual limit if eligible.
3.  **TFSA / RRSP:** Based on your income bracket (see above).

## Deadline Checklist

1.  **Check your room:** Login to CRA My Account today.
2.  **Decide the amount:** Use the **[Toolisk Income Tax Calculator](/finance/calculators/income-tax)** to see the impact on your refund.
3.  **Make the transfer:** Don't wait until 11:59 PM on March 2. Banks can take 1-2 days to process.
4.  **Invest it!** Contributing cash is just step 1. Don't leave it in a 0.05% interest savings account inside your RRSP. Buy ETFs, stocks, or GICs.

**Pro Tip:** If you contribute in the first 60 days of 2026, you *can* choose to delay the deduction to a future year if you expect a big raise. You get the tax-sheltered growth now, and the bigger tax refund later.
