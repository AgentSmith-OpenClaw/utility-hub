# US Tax Planning 2026: Preparing for the TCJA Sunset

The biggest story in US personal finance for 2026 is the upcoming expiration of many provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). For most taxpayers, this means higher rates and lower deductions are on the near future.

## What's Changing?
Unless Congress acts, tax brackets will revert to their 2017 levels, meaning the current 12% bracket could jump to 15%, and the 22% bracket to 25%. More importantly, the Standard Deduction is set to be nearly halved.

## High-Intent Actions for 2026
- **Accelerate Income:** If you're in a position to take bonuses or realize gains in 2025/2026, it may be cheaper than waiting for 2027.
- **Max Out Retirement:** Reducing your taxable income is more valuable when rates are higher.
- **Evaluate Itemizing:** Start tracking your potential itemized deductions now to see if they will exceed the lower standard deduction in the future.

## The "Trump State of the Union" Impact
With the President's recent address, all eyes are on potential tax extensions or new reform packages. Staying agile is key.
