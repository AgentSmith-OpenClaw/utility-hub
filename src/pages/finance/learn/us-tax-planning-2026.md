# US Tax Planning 2026: Navigating the Sunset of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

For American taxpayers, 2026 is not just another tax year; it represents one of the most significant shifts in the internal revenue code in a decade. With the expiration of many provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the "sunset" is finally here, and it carries profound implications for your take-home pay, deductions, and estate planning.

## The Big Shift: What's Expiring?

Unless Congress takes further action, many individual income tax provisions are reverting to their pre-2018 levels. This isn't just a minor adjustment; it's a fundamental restructuring of the tax brackets and standard deductions.

### 1. Rising Tax Rates
Most individual tax brackets are set to increase. For example, the 12% bracket will return to 15%, the 22% bracket to 25%, and the top rate will climb back from 37% to 39.6%. For the average family, this could mean an increase of several thousand dollars in annual tax liability.

### 2. The Standard Deduction Halves
One of the most popular features of the TCJA was the nearly doubled standard deduction. In 2026, this is expected to drop significantly (adjusted for inflation). While this makes itemizing more attractive again, it also increases the taxable income for those who don't have enough expenses to itemize.

### 3. Personal Exemptions Return
The TCJA eliminated personal exemptions in favor of a higher standard deduction. In 2026, personal exemptions return, which may provide some relief for larger families, though this is often offset by the lower standard deduction.

## Strategic Moves for 2026

Given these changes, proactive planning is essential. Here are three strategies to consider:

**Income Acceleration:** If you expect to be in a higher bracket in 2026, it may make sense to pull income into 2025 where possible—such as by realizing capital gains or taking discretionary bonuses.

**Roth Conversions:** 2025 may be the last year to convert traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA at the current lower tax rates. Doing so now "locks in" the current rates before the 2026 hike.

**Itemization Review:** With the lower standard deduction, expenses like mortgage interest, state and local taxes (up to the $10,000 SALT cap, which also faces scrutiny), and charitable contributions may once again yield higher tax savings than the standard deduction.

## Understanding Your New Take-Home Pay

The combination of higher rates and lower deductions means your "net pay" will look different starting in January 2026. It is crucial to adjust your withholdings early to avoid a surprise bill when you file in 2027.
