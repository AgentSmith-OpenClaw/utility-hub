# The 1099-DA Guide Guide: Understanding the New US Crypto Tax Rules in 2026

If you’ve been trading crypto, you probably noticed a new form hitting your inbox this February: the **Form 1099-DA**. While the IRS has been talking about "Digital Asset" reporting for years, 2026 is the year it finally becomes a reality for every retail investor in the US.

But there is a massive catch that could cost you thousands in overpaid taxes if you aren't careful. Here is everything you need to know about the 1099-DA, the "missing basis" trap, and how to use our [Crypto Tax Calculator](https://toolisk.com/finance/crypto-profit-calculator) to stay ahead.

## What is Form 1099-DA?

The "DA" stands for Digital Asset. Think of it as the crypto version of the 1099-B you get from a stockbroker. For the 2025 tax year (which you are filing now in early 2026), central exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are required to report your gross proceeds from sales directly to the IRS.

### The Deadline
Brokers were required to issue these forms by **February 17, 2026**. If you haven't seen yours yet, check your "Tax Documents" section on your exchange dashboard immediately.

## The Trap: Missing Cost Basis

Here is the problem: For most transactions made in 2025, brokers are reporting the **sale price (proceeds)** but they are *not* required to report your **cost basis** (what you originally paid for the crypto).

If the IRS sees you sold $50,000 worth of Bitcoin, but doesn't see that you bought it for $45,000, they might assume your profit was $50,000. Without a cost basis, you could be taxed on the full amount rather than just the $5,000 gain.

### Why is basis missing?
If you transferred Bitcoin from a hardware wallet to an exchange and then sold it, the exchange has no idea what you paid for it. They only see the "inbound" transfer and the "outbound" sale.

## 3 Steps to Avoid Overpaying

1.  **Gather Your "Inbound" Records:** You need to find the original purchase price for any crypto you sold in 2025. Look at old emails, hardware wallet logs, or other exchange exports.
2.  **Choose Your Accounting Method:** The IRS generally defaults to **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**, but you might save money using **HIFO (Highest-In, First-Out)** if you want to minimize your taxable gains this year.
3.  **Manually Calculate the Gap:** Since your 1099-DA is likely incomplete, you must manually enter your cost basis on your tax return.

## FAQs for the 2026 Season

**Q: Does the IRS know about my DeFi trades?**
A: Currently, the 1099-DA rules mostly apply to centralized brokers. However, the IRS is actively working on regulations for non-custodial and decentralized platforms. "Good faith" reporting is your best defense against future audits.

**Q: What if I lost my records?**
A: Use a blockchain explorer to trace your wallet's history. Proving you paid *something* is always better than letting the IRS assume a cost basis of zero.
