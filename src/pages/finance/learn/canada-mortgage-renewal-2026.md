# Canada's 2026 Mortgage Cliff: How to Handle Your Renewal This Year

For hundreds of thousands of Canadian homeowners, 2026 is the year of the "Mortgage Cliff." Many who locked in record-low rates during the 2020-2021 pandemic boom are now facing renewals at rates that are significantly higher—in some cases, double or triple what they were paying before.

Bank of Canada data shows that roughly 15% of all Canadian mortgages are up for renewal in 2025-2026. If you are one of them, the time to plan is now.

## The Reality of the "Payment Shock"

If you are coming off a 5-year fixed rate of 1.99% and moving to a current 2026 rate of 4.5% or 5%, your monthly payments won't just go up a little—they will skyrocket. 

For a $500,000 mortgage, that interest rate jump could mean an extra $700 to $1,000 per month in interest alone. This is the "payment shock" that is forcing many Canadians to rethink their household budgets.

## 3 Tips to Soften the Blow

### 1. Lump Sum Payments (Before Renewal)
If you have any savings, putting a lump sum toward your principal *before* you renew can significantly lower your new monthly payment. Because your principal is lower, the higher interest rate has a smaller base to act upon.

### 2. Extending Your Amortization
While not ideal for long-term wealth building, some lenders are allowing homeowners to extend their amortization back to 25 or 30 years to keep the monthly payments manageable. 
**Caution:** This will lower your monthly "burn," but it will cost you tens of thousands more in interest over the life of the loan. Use an [Amortization Calculator](https://toolisk.com/finance/amortization-calculator) to see the true cost of an extension.

### 3. Shopping the "B" Lenders
If your debt-to-income ratio has tightened due to the cost of living, traditional big banks might be less flexible. Credit unions and "B" lenders sometimes offer more creative solutions for renewals, though often at slightly higher rates.

## The Tax Angle: Moving for Work?
With the 2026 federal tax brackets adjusted (14% for the first $58,523), many Canadians are considering moving to provinces with lower provincial tax or better housing affordability, like Alberta or parts of the Maritimes. If you are renewing a mortgage on a property you plan to leave, consider a **portable mortgage** that allows you to take your current rate and terms to a new home.
