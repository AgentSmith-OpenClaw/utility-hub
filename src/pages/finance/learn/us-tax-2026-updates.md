The 2026 tax season isn't just another year of paperwork. Between the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and the IRS's new aggressive stance on documentation, your usual "copy-paste" approach from last year will likely trigger an audit or a massive delay.

## The New Brackets
The IRS adjusted the numbers. If you haven't checked where you land, you're likely overpaying or under-saving.

| Tax Rate | Single Filers | Married (Joint) |
|,,,,,|,,,,,,,-|,,,,,,,,-|
| 10% | Up to $12,000 | Up to $24,000 |
| 12% | $12,001 – $48,000 | $24,001 – $96,000 |
| 22% | $48,001 – $100,000 | $96,001 – $200,000 |
| 24% | $100,001 – $190,000 | $200,001 – $380,000 |
| 32% | $190,001 – $240,000 | $380,001 – $480,000 |
| 35% | $240,001 – $600,000 | $480,001 – $700,000 |
| 37% | Over $600,000 | Over $700,000 |

## The Bill That Changed Everything
The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is the primary driver this year. It sounds like marketing, but the math is real. The standard deduction is up, which simplifies things for most, but the new "Patriot" deductions for small businesses and the Senior Security Credits are where the real savings are hidden. If you're running a side hustle or supporting older family members, don't miss these.

## The IRS Warning
The IRS issued a rare pre-season warning: document verification is tighter. They are using more automated flags for the 2026 season. If your forms don't match their new standards, expect your refund to be held in "manual review" purgatory for months.
