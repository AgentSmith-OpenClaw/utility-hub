The IRS and CRA have finished their "education phase." In 2026, crypto tax enforcement is in full effect. If you traded in 2025, you are on the radar.

## What's Reportable?
Everything. Swapping BTC for ETH is a taxable event. Buying an NFT is a taxable event. Earning 5% on your stablecoins is interest income. The IRS is now explicitly categorizing NFTs under digital asset rules, meaning the old "it's art" excuse won't save you from capital gains tax.

## Holding Periods
The difference between a 15% and 37% tax rate is exactly 366 days. If you're selling, check your purchase dates. Short-term gains are punished heavily under the 2026 brackets.
