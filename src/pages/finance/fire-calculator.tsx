          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The 4% rule suggests you can withdraw 4% of your retirement corpus annually, adjusted for inflation, with high probability your money lasts 30+ years. It originates from US historical data. In India, conservative planners use 3-3.5% due to longer lifespans, higher inflation volatility, and less developed markets. A ₹1 crore corpus supports ₹3-4 lakh annual expenses safely."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Multiply your annual expenses by 25-33 depending on safety margin desired. For ₹10 lakh annual expenses, target ₹2.5-3.3 crores. This assumes 3-4% safe withdrawal rate. Factor in healthcare inflation, lifestyle changes, and no pension income. Most successful FIRE achievers in India target 30-35x annual expenses for comfortable early retirement."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Early portfolio losses during retirement are devastating because you're withdrawing simultaneously. A 30% crash in your first retirement year forces selling units at depressed prices, permanently reducing your corpus. The same average returns in different sequences produce vastly different outcomes. This is why retirees need conservative asset allocation and cash buffers."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, unless you plan to sell and downsize or rent. Your primary residence provides housing, not income. If you need ₹8 lakhs annually and own a ₹2 crore house, you still need separate corpus to generate that ₹8 lakhs. Only count home equity if you'll definitely liquidate it during retirement - which most people don't."
        }

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Is Coast FIRE more realistic than full FIRE?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For many people, yes. Coast FIRE means accumulating enough that compound growth covers retirement without additional contributions, letting you work less stressfully for current expenses. Barista FIRE involves part-time work covering living costs while investments compound. These variants reduce the massive corpus needed for full early retirement while improving quality of life."
