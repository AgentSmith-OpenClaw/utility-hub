        <h1>EMI Calculator for Home Loan, Car Loan & Personal Loan in India</h1>
        <p>Calculate your monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for home loan, car loan, personal loan, or any other loan using our free online EMI calculator. Our advanced calculator features prepayment analysis, reduce EMI vs reduce tenure comparison, 8 interactive charts, and Excel export.</p>
        
        <h2>What is EMI?</h2>
        <p>EMI stands for <strong>Equated Monthly Installment</strong>. It is the fixed amount you pay every month to the bank or financial institution until the loan is fully repaid. The EMI consists of two components: <strong>principal repayment</strong> and <strong>interest payment</strong>. In the initial months, a larger portion goes towards interest. As time passes, more of your EMI goes towards repaying the principal.</p>
        
        <h2>EMI Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>The standard EMI formula is: <strong>EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal Loan Amount</li>
          <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)</li>
          <li><strong>n</strong> = Loan Tenure in Months</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, a home loan of ₹50,00,000 at 8.5% annual interest for 20 years (240 months) would have a monthly EMI of approximately ₹43,391.</p>

        <h2>Reduce EMI vs Reduce Tenure — Which Prepayment Strategy to Choose?</h2>
        <p>When you make a prepayment (part-payment) on your loan, you typically have two options:</p>
        <h3>🎯 Reduce Tenure (Recommended for Maximum Savings)</h3>
        <p>Your monthly EMI stays the same, but the loan duration decreases. This means you pay off the loan faster and save significantly on interest. For a ₹50 lakh home loan, reducing tenure with prepayments can save ₹15-25 lakhs in interest.</p>
        <h3>💰 Reduce EMI (Better for Cash Flow)</h3>
        <p>Your loan duration stays the same, but your monthly EMI decreases after each prepayment. This gives you immediate cash flow relief and lower monthly commitments.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about EMI</h2>
        <h3>How is home loan EMI calculated?</h3>
        <p>Home loan EMI is calculated using the reducing balance method. The formula is EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1). Enter your home loan amount, interest rate, and tenure in our calculator to get instant results with detailed charts.</p>
        
        <h3>Can prepayments reduce my home loan tenure?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Making prepayments with the "Reduce Tenure" strategy directly shortens your loan duration while keeping your EMI the same. Even small quarterly prepayments of ₹50,000-₹1,00,000 can reduce a 20-year home loan by 5-8 years.</p>

        <h3>What is the ideal prepayment strategy?</h3>
        <p>If your goal is to save maximum interest, choose Reduce Tenure. If you need lower monthly payments, choose Reduce EMI. Our calculator lets you compare both strategies with exact numbers and charts.</p>
